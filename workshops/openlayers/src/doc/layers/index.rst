Working With Layers
===================

Every OpenLayers map has one or more layers. Layers display the geospatial data that the user sees on the map.

.. rubric:: What this module covers

This module covers the basics of working with map layers.  In this module you will use a standard WMS layer, work with cached tiles, use a proprietary tile service, and render data client side.
