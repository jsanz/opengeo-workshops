Creating a Map
==============

In OpenLayers, a map is a collection of layers and various controls for dealing with user interaction. A map is generated with three basic ingredients: :ref:`markup <openlayers.basics.dissect.markup>`, :ref:`style declarations <openlayers.basics.dissect.style>`, and :ref:`initialization code <openlayers.basics.dissect.code>`.

Working Example
---------------

Let's take a look at a fully working example of an OpenLayers map.

.. code-block:: html

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>My Map</title>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="openlayers/theme/default/style.css" type="text/css">
            <style>
                #map-id {
                    width: 512px;
                    height: 256px;
                }
            </style>
            <script src="openlayers/lib/OpenLayers.js"></script>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>My Map</h1>
            <div id="map-id"></div>
            <script>
                var map = new OpenLayers.Map("map-id");
                var imagery = new OpenLayers.Layer.WMS(
                    "Global Imagery",
                    "http://maps.opengeo.org/geowebcache/service/wms",
                    {layers: "bluemarble"}
                );
                map.addLayer(imagery);
                map.zoomToMaxExtent();
            </script>
        </body>
    </html>

.. rubric:: Tasks

#.  Copy the text above into a new file called :file:`map.html`, and save it in the root of the workshop folder.

#.  Open the working map in your web browser: http://localhost:8082/ol_workshop/map.html

.. figure:: map1.png

    A working map of displaying imagery of the world.


.. note:: You can use *medit* (:menuselection:`Applications --> Accesories --> medit`) as your HTML editor for this workshop, it's easy to use and has several nice features like syntax highlighting, line numbers, file explorer panel, etc.
   

   .. image:: medit.png
      :align: center
      :alt: medit editor
      :width: 300px


Having successfully created our first map, we'll continue by looking more closely at :ref:`the parts <openlayers.basics.dissect>`.
