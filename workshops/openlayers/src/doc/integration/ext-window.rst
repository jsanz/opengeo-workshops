.. _openlayers.integration.ext-window:

The Ext JS Window
=================

Ext JS provides windows with behavior and looks familiar to desktop application
developers. The theme for an Ext based application is moderately configurable,
though developing custom themes can be labor-intensive. Using Ext windows to
display map related information gives your application a well integrated feel if
you are using Ext widgets for non-map related parts of your application.

An Ext window can be created with no existing markup. The following code creates
a modeless window and opens it.

.. code-block:: javascript

    var win = new Ext.Window({
        title: "Window",
        items: [
            {html: "Hello!"}
        ]
    });
    win.show();

Ext builds complex elements based on containers with one or more items. The
window above contains a panel element that was created from the string
``"Hello!"`` Using the above technique, windows can be created to display
information about features on your map.

                        4284890, 253985,

                    var slider = new Ext.Slider({
                        renderTo: "slider-id",
                        value: 100,
                        listeners: {
                            change: function(el, val) {
                                base.setOpacity(val / 100);
                            }

#.  To this example, we'll be adding an ``OpenLayers.Control.SelectFeature``
    control so that the user can select a feature. In your map initialization code,
    add the following `after` the creation of your ``buildings`` layer:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        var select = new OpenLayers.Control.SelectFeature([buildings]);
        map.addControl(select);
        select.activate();

#.  Next we need to create a listener for the ``featureselected`` event on our
    ``buildings`` layer.  We'll create a window populated with feature
    information when the user selects a feature (by clicking on it with the
    mouse).  In addition, we want to destroy the window when a feature is
    unselected.  We can do this by listening for the ``featureunselected``
    event.  Insert the following in your map initialization code somehere
    `after` the creation of the ``buildings`` layer:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        var dialog;
        buildings.events.on({
            featureselected: function(event) {
                var feature = event.feature;
                var area = feature.geometry.getArea();
                var id = feature.attributes.key;
                var output = "Building: " + id + " Area: " + area.toFixed(2);
                dialog = new Ext.Window({
                    title: "Feature Info",
                    layout: "fit",
                    height: 80, width: 130,
                    plain: true,
                    items: [{
                        border: false,
                        bodyStyle: {
                            padding: 5, fontSize: 13
                        },
                        html: output
                    }]
                });
                dialog.show();
            },
            featureunselected: function() {
                dialog.destroy();
            }
        });

#.  Generally speaking, setting element styles in code is bad.  Ext allows for
    easy style declarations in the component configuration with the ``style``
    and ``bodyStyle`` properties.  In addition, Ext makes it easy to set CSS
    class names for components via the ``cls`` property. Experiment with adding
    a class name to the window contents and using declarations in your CSS
    instead of the ``bodyStyle`` configuration option above.

#.  Find the ``Ext.Window`` constructor in the Ext documentation.  Change the
    configuration of the windows in your ``map.html`` example to make them modal
    windows. Your application will not receive browser events until the
    window is closed.
