2013 OpenLayers 2 Workshop
==========================

Welcome to the **OpenLayers Workshop**. This workshop is designed to
give you a comprehensive overview of OpenLayers as a web mapping solution.  The
exercises assume that you have set up a local GeoServer with the workshop
data as described in the :doc:`setup` page.


The workshop has been adapted from the official `Open Geo OpenLayers workshop <http://workshops.opengeo.org/openlayers-intro/>`_ for the `Open Source Opportunities in GIS Summer School <http://www.sigte.udg.edu/summerschool2013/>`_. This course is coordinated by the `GIS and Remote Sensing Centre <http://www.sigte.udg.edu/sigte_en/>`_ of the University of Girona in collaboration with the `Nottingham Geospatial Institute <http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ngi/index.aspx>`_ and `Prodevelop <http://www.prodevelop.es>`_.

The instructors of the OpenLayers workshop are:

This workshop is presented as a set of modules. In each module the reader will
perform a set of tasks designed to achieve a specific goal for that module. Each
module builds upon lessons learned in previous modules and is designed to
iteratively build up the reader's knowledge base.
